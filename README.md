### Goal
This program is tend to develop a cervical vertebrae assistant system to notify user when they are not at the appropriate position facing the computer.

### Idea
We divide the whole program into three parts -- camera, cushion and wireless communication.
#### Camera
Camera part mainly aimed to parse the user's face part. Though the identification of eyes and nose, we could find the angle of the user to the camera.
#### Cushion
Cushion part mainly deals with the sitting position of the user. We want to use certain method to determine the user's position on the cushion
#### wireless communication
Bluetooth is used at present. Wireless communication is used to transport the cushion information to the computer.

### Tech
#### Arduino
Arduino is used to collect the pressure information on the cushion
## OpenCV
OpenCV is used to find the eyes and nose
#### Random forest
This predictor model is used to determine the sitting type
